# A tiny lisp interpreter

This is the smallest Lisp interpreter I've written.

## Features

- Interprets programs with the typical read-eval-print loop.
- Function definition with `(define name body)` or `(define (name arg0 ...) body)`.
- Integer, double, boolean and `cons` based list data types.
- Lists builtin functions `cons`, `car` and `cdr`.
- Conditions with `(if cond then else)` builtin function.
- Loops with conditions and recursion only.
- Standard output with `print` builtin function.
- `quote` builtin function and `'` shorthand.

```sh
./lisp < example.lisp
```
